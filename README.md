# Space: The Final Frontier

*__Abstract__*: The project aims to study the fundamentals of designing a space mission and to acknowledge the efforts made by space research organisations in designing and executing successful space programs. We shall understand the foundations of rocket design and propulsion systems along with the dynamics and systems which keep things that we sent to space, in space. Eventually, we shall look at the future of interstellar travel and what we must achieve before our goal becomes a reality.
